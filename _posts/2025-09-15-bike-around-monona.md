Hi all,

PhD has been busy and I have been less active than usual here. BUT, yesterday I finally took Ananke (my new bike ‚Äì Phobos now belongs to Luen) to a fun bike ride! Me and some other PhD friends from my cohort went around Lake Monona. If you never saw Madison‚Äôs map, Madison, WI is a Isthmus, which means that it is a stretch of land that separates two bodies of water. It is in a diagonal and it has a lake North-west, called Mendota, and another lake at south-east, called Monona.

Here are some photos of the adventure :)

This was on one of our first stops. You can see Ananke posing by a view that shows the WI State Capitol afar.

We stopped by a popular Ice-cream stop near a lake beach. I swear, the decor in that ice cream shop was so so American that I could even hear the faint sound of the star spangled banner playing from the pure energy of the place. The ice cream was great :D

Here you can also see the capitol from afar, behind me being silly. Different from the first photo, where that was one of our first stops, this one was near the end of the loop :)

We finished the ride at the same point we started: the Monona Terrace, which is a convention center. We got this epic photo from the top of the terrace, overseeing the just-conquered lake Monona

Next one: Mendota! (at some point, hopefully‚Ä¶ Mendota is probably a full day endeavor)
