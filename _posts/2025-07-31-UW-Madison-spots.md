Wow my first post (in my new website). If you're seeing this with less than 5 spots listed, good job you went to scavenge my website. If not, still nice to see you here after you got this from my email :)

I promised myself that I would not be like most graduate students who do not know their campuses beyond the paths between labs and offices and home. I like the idea that I know where all resources of an institution are. So I will be publishing my finds of cool spaces here so that I have a motivation to find new spots. To be totally transparent, I am going to be using [this post](https://buckygrades.com/study/) as a reference for most of these spaces, but will be doing the work of finding them and taking my own photos. This post will be updated every time a new spot is found, so come visit this post back every now and then if you'd like.

## Graduate Study Room - Memorial Library (2025-07-31)

I found this space in the 4th floor of Memorial Library that is this nice lounge with sofas and cubicles for studying.
