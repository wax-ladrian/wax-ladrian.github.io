This was supposed to be an opinion piece I have been thinking in writing for the last 8 months. It's a subject I think a lot about for years, and at about 8 months ago, Hank published this video on Vlogbrothers talking about the ways the Internet is similar to other Media Revolutions in how it makes some people empowered to use populism as a tool to manipulate masses against established institutions (sometimes for good but most times, things were more complicated than the populist messages). It also talks about the ways the Internet is absolutely different from those other Media Revolutions.

I have been watching this video on repeat for the last 8 months and every time I do I realize how masterfully Hank managed to explain the things out, including the uncertainties about the situation we're in, so I will not necessarily write here the things I got from the video as a full thing but, instead, will urge you to watch it if you have the time. I ensure you that I could not really put down in words/phrases/paragraphs the things he discussed in any way that makes it worth it to read this post instead of listening to the video.

You will notice the video has a bibliography, and I actually recently finished my read of ["High Conflict" by Amanda Ripley](https://www.amandaripley.com/high-conflict "https://www.amandaripley.com/high-conflict") and, if you have the time, I highly recommend this book, it has many insights on the mechanisms that makes humans get extreme in their conflicts, be it the way societies usually get polarized, be it the way relationships get polarized.
