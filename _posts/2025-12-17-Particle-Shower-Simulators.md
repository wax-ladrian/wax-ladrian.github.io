The GitHub project is out [here](https://github.com/wax-ladrian/Particle-shower-simulator?tab=readme-ov-file).

For my PHYS 772 (Intro to High Energy Astrophysics) project this year was to characterize the transmission of high energy gamma rays through long intergalactic distances, and specially characterizing the effect the existence of a Intergalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF) it would have. My simulation codes for photon-photon pair creation, and for inverse Compton scattering, and it also generates Synchrotron photons. Check out my work in [my final paper](https://github.com/wax-ladrian/Particle-shower-simulator/blob/main/project_paper.pdf) for the class.

Here's a jet simulation I made with my script, adding it here because it is fun to play with. Green = injected photons; Red, Blue = positron, electron; Pink = IC photon. Synchrotron photons are omitted.
