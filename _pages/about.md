# Who am I
Hi all, Iâ€™m Orisvaldo (I often go by Oris) and I am currently a first year PhD student at UW-Madison's Physics Department. Once I am in a research group you will be able to read a lot about it here, but for now if you want to see which classes I am taking, you can check the [classes page](/classes/). 

# Previously
I did my undergraduate studies at MIT (Class of 2023), B.S. in Physics with minors in Astronomy and Mathematics.

After that I worked at MIT's Physics Department as a Technical Instructor for MIT's Junior Lab, where physics majors get their Experimental Physics classes. I was also, broadly, part of the [Physics Education Group at MIT](https://peg.mit.edu), which means I had at times helped out in classes beyond Junior Lab

In addition to Physics and teaching, I am a big enjoyer of music. When at MIT, I was part of an a cappella group called [Toons](https://toons.mit.edu).  I have arranged a few songs and performed a few time. Check out more in the [music and arts](/music-and-art/) page.

This website is still under construction. I have my [original website](https://sites.mit.edu/oris) for when I was working at MIT. Publications and Talks pages are not up yet but you can check mine in my [CV](/cv/).
