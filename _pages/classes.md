Interactions among the particles, fields, and radiation of interstellar and intergalactic space. Gamma-ray, x-ray, and cosmic ray production, propagation, and detection. Knowledge of electrodynamics (such as [PHYSICS 322](https://guide.wisc.edu/search/?P=PHYSICS%20322 "PHYSICS 322")) strongly encouraged.

### **PHYSICS 701 — GRADUATE INTRODUCTORY SEMINARS**

Designed to give new students an introduction to the broad range of modern research going on at UW Physics, and to help students find research opportunities in the department. Each week, faculty from each major research area will present their research in a seminar setting. The research areas will include selected topics both in theory and experiment from biophysics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; plasma; condensed matter; quantum information and computation; high energy and nuclear physics; particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.
