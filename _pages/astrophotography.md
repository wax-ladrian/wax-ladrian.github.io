Here some samples of my astrophotography. I get to do it less lately, but always try to get my camera out if the opportunity shows up! Also, some of these are taken with my iPhone which is just insane... technology nowadays is truly impressive.

## MIT Wallace Astrophysical Observatory

I spent a summer doing observational research there during undergrad, and also TA'ed for the Intro to Hands-On Astronomy class a few times. I also took the Observational Astronomy class sequence 12.409, 12.410, and 12.411.

## Teide Observatory

The class 12.411, the "Astronomy Field Camp," gave me the opportunity to spend a month working at the Teide Observatory, in the Canary Islands. Here some photos from that.
