# MIT-Wellesley Toons

From Spring 2024 to the end of Spring 2025 I was part of the [MIT-Wellesley Toons A Cappella Group](https://toons.mit.edu), where I got to play bass and tenor roles in multiple songs :)

# Musical Theater

## Fall 2022
I participated in a musical back in Fall 2022, "Jekyll & Hyde", put up by the [MIT Musical Theater Guild](https://mtg.mit.edu/8/).
